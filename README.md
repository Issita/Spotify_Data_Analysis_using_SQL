## Overview

In this project, I work with a Spotify dataset that includes various track, album, and artist attributes. The process involves converting a denormalized dataset into a normalized structure, writing SQL queries of increasing complexity (from basic to advanced), and optimizing query performance. The key aims are to enhance my SQL expertise and uncover valuable trends in the dataset.
