## Overview

In this project, I work with a Spotify dataset that includes various track, album, and artist attributes. The process involves converting a denormalized dataset into a normalized structure, writing SQL queries of increasing complexity (from basic to advanced), and optimizing query performance. The key aims are to enhance my SQL expertise and uncover valuable trends in the dataset.


## Data Exploration

Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:

- **Artist:** The performer of the track.
- **Track:** The name of the song.
- **Album:** The album to which the track belongs.
- **Album_type:** The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as **danceability, energy, loudness, tempo,** and more.
